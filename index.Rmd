# Introduction

## Course Overview

This course focuses on Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), a critical method for understanding the spatial distribution of species and their relationship with environmental variables. SDMs are widely applied in various fields, including biodiversity conservation, ecological research, and environmental management. Participants will explore key concepts in SDM, spatial data handling, and best practices for model evaluation and projection.

The course content is divided into lecture topics and practical sessions. Lectures cover the theoretical framework, offering an in-depth understanding of the underlying principles of SDMs. Meanwhile, the practical sessions provide hands-on experience with spatial data and SDM algorithms using R, equipping participants with the skills needed for real-world applications. Lecture recordings, PDFs, and relevant papers are shared through a Google Drive folder, which is updated periodically throughout the course【45†source】【47†source】.

Additionally, this course emphasizes the importance of critical thinking when applying SDMs. Participants will learn to assess the strengths and limitations of different modeling approaches, ensuring they make informed decisions during their own analyses.

## Logistics and Structure

The course spans two weeks, with meetings scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Each session includes lectures, discussions, and practical exercises designed to reinforce learning outcomes. The structured schedule ensures that participants gain both theoretical knowledge and practical experience by balancing lecture content with applied activities.

All essential files, including datasets, R scripts, and supplementary reading materials, are organized in separate folders within the shared Google Drive. This resource hub allows students to easily access and download the materials needed for each session. Students are encouraged to explore these resources and follow along during practical sessions to maximize their learning experience【46†source】【50†source】.

Participants have also been advised to install key R libraries before the course begins. A script (`installlibs.R`) is available in the code folder to facilitate this process. This script installs most of the necessary libraries, minimizing technical issues during the sessions. For participants who encounter difficulties, support is available to ensure a smooth installation process【51†source】【59†source】.

## Instructor Background

The instructor holds a background in aerospace engineering but transitioned into ecological modeling after developing a keen interest in understanding biodiversity patterns. This unique background brings a multidisciplinary approach to the course, combining analytical rigor from engineering with ecological insights. Their research spans from genomic variation to community-level biodiversity modeling, with a focus on climate adaptation and vulnerability assessment【48†source】【55†source】.

Over the years, the instructor has contributed to several high-impact studies on climate change, invasive species, and habitat suitability modeling. These experiences provide participants with practical insights into the complexities of ecological modeling and real-world applications of SDMs.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of spatial data and species distribution modeling.
- Identify and address challenges in working with spatial data, including issues related to resolution, data accuracy, and environmental predictors【53†source】【58†source】.
- Apply various SDM algorithms, with a focus on MaxEnt, a popular tool for presence-only data. MaxEnt’s capabilities will be explored in depth, highlighting its strengths and common pitfalls【56†source】【57†source】.
- Evaluate and interpret SDM outputs, ensuring adherence to best practices. Participants will learn to assess model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
- Explore future climate scenarios and ensemble modeling to predict species distribution under changing environmental conditions. The course will introduce advanced topics, such as downscaling climate data and combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy【52†source】【54†source】.

## Practical Exercises

Two key practicals have been developed for this course:

1. **Handling Spatial Data:** Preparing spatial data for SDM, including loading, manipulating, and visualizing spatial datasets in R. This exercise helps participants become familiar with common spatial data formats, such as shapefiles and raster files, and how to process them efficiently.
2. **Fitting and Evaluating SDMs:** Applying SDM algorithms, evaluating model performance, and interpreting results. This practical focuses on using MaxEnt and other algorithms, covering essential steps like variable selection, model fitting, and output interpretation【46†source】【49†source】.

Solutions to these exercises will be provided after the course to enable participants to compare their approaches with the instructor’s solutions. These practicals are designed to foster independent learning, encouraging participants to experiment with different methods and improve their analytical skills.

## Communication and Support

Participants are encouraged to actively engage during sessions by asking questions and sharing insights. While there is a chat feature for communication, raising hands or unmuting to ask questions directly is preferred for better interaction. The instructor will make every effort to address queries during the session, but participants are also welcome to follow up via email or during breaks【51†source】【55†source】.

Collaboration among participants is highly encouraged. Sharing experiences and discussing challenges can enhance the learning experience for everyone. A dedicated discussion forum may be set up, depending on participant interest, to facilitate ongoing conversations and support.

## Key References

The course references several recent papers on best practices in SDM, published around 2019-2020. These papers are available in the Google Drive under the "Best Practices" folder. Participants are recommended to review these papers to enhance their understanding of effective workflows and methodologies【50†source】【59†source】.

In addition, supplementary readings covering advanced topics, such as ensemble modeling and climate change projections, will be provided. These readings offer valuable insights for participants interested in pursuing further research or applications in SDM.

This introductory chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the course, setting the stage for more detailed discussions on spatial data, SDM algorithms, and advanced modeling techniques in the subsequent chapters. With a balance of theory and practice, this course aims to equip participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to confidently apply SDMs in various ecological and environmental contexts.
